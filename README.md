# Printing Machine
This repo contains a notebook for Printing Machine data exploration, data cleansing and data prediction that I did as a Data Analyst Intern. I used N-Beats and RNN to predict the speed, output, downtime, and runtime of 6 machines. The dataset has been removed and the names of machines and materials used on the data has been changed for confidentiality.
